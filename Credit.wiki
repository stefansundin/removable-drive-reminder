#summary A little history and who made what

= Introduction =

Removable Drive Reminder is developed by Stefan Sundin. You can visit my website at [http://stefansundin.com stefansundin.com].

This program was inspired by [http://www.bgreco.net/reminder.php Flash Drive Reminder]. I needed to have an installable version (on the computer rather than the USB stick), but Brad Greco told me that he had unfortunately lost the source code. So I decided to start out from scratch.

The icon comes from the [http://schollidesign.deviantart.com/art/Human-O2-Iconset-105344123 Human-O2 icon set] by schollidesign (GPL).
